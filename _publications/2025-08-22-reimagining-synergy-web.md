### Abstract

This study reconsiders the evolving relationship between architects and computational systems in the context of
increasingly embedded digital and intelligent technologies. Rather than focusing only on what tools can do, it looks at
how tool-making itself helps reshape how architects think and work. Through four web-based generative design
applications—SIMForms, ANYSite, NEXUSpace, and FLEXUrban—this paper investigates how architects engage with computation
not only as tool users, but also as developers of generative algorithms, and organizers of workflows. Based on these
cases, the paper proposes a framework of three interrelated mechanisms of human-computer collaboration: reconstructing
intuitive media, adopting algorithmic design thinking, and organizing programmable design systems. The framework aims to
provide a conceptual foundation for reimagining how architects can stay actively involved in shaping the tools and
processes that define digital design today.
