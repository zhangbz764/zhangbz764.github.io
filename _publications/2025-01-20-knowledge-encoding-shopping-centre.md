### Abstract

This paper presents a rule-based procedural generation approach for layout design by design knowledge encoding. Taking
linear shopping centres as example, the proposed method encodes the layout design elements of the walkway space, tenant
areas, and staircases into generative rules based on geometric operations. The generative rules integrate the shopping
centre layoutâ€™s spatial patterns and geometric features and incorporate user-specified interaction parameters to form a
generation tool prototype for early-stage layout design. The results show that the method can deal with the complex
spatial elements of linear shopping centres and provide design references for architects, which helps combine generative
algorithms with the design process.
