### Abstract

As computational design becomes increasingly integrated into architectural education, balancing technical complexity
with creative exploration remains a challenge. This study presents a web-based framework supporting architectural design
studios through computational tools. Three applications—ANYSite, NEXUSpace, and SnapRender—assist in plot subdivision,
spatial layout generation, and AI-augmented visualization. Implemented in a design studio, these tools provide
structured guidance, lower learning barriers, and enhance engagement with computational methods. The study evaluates the
effectiveness of these tools by analyzing student projects and feedback. Findings suggest that systematic workflow and
task-oriented tool functions help students focus on design strategies while integrating computational techniques. This
research contributes to architecture pedagogy by demonstrating how web-based tools can make computational design more
accessible and interactive in architectural education.
