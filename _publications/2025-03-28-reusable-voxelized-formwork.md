### Abstract

The increasing demand for complex concrete structures presents significant challenges in formwork fabrication, including
high costs, material waste, and limited adaptability. Traditional formwork systems struggle to accommodate the intricate
geometries of freeform designs and topology-optimized structures. This study introduces a reusable voxelized magnetic
formwork system, leveraging an octree-based Marching Cubes algorithm to articulate diverse concrete geometries. The
integration of magnets is carefully engineered to address the challenges of unit assembly orientation, ensuring
efficient alignment and stability throughout the process. The proposed method integrates computational modelling with a
voxel-based formwork system, aiming to reconcile precision with adaptability. The contributions include: (1) Using
computer graphics models to identify both applicable and non-applicable scenarios, reflecting the system's
flexibility. (2) Demonstrating its suitability for casting topology-optimized structures with complex forms. (3)
Performing assembly experiments, exploring the practical feasibility of formwork fabrication and reuse. Results reveal
that the system ensures high geometric fidelity and enhances reusability. The reusable voxelized magnetic formwork is a
promising alternative to conventional formwork and fully customized freeform solutions.
