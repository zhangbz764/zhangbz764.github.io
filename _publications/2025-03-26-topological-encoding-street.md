### Abstract

Capturing the principles of existing street generation is crucial for guiding urban renewal and development. This study
introduces a novel topological encoding method for street networks, which is designed to adapt to diverse contextual
conditions. We propose a flexible and adaptive street networ k generation method using tensor fields, which allows user
to generate the street network step by step. This method utilizes the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree data
structure to create basic street network prototypes within tensor fields, offering straightforward encoding and decoding
processes that make it ideal for data exchange in web applications. Building on this framework, the research presents
FLEXUrban, an innovative webbased interactive application. FLEXUrban establishes a comprehensive design workflow,
encompassing site data import, streamline field editing, site subdivision, and building generation. By integrating these
stages, the application simplifies the urban design process, enabling urban planners and architects to generate
contextually adaptive and efficient urban designs. This approach fosters smarter and sustainable development practices,
ensuring adaptability to the dynamic challenges of modern urban environments.
